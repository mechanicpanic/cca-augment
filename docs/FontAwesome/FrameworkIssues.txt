If you have any errors with the framework during the build, try the following steps:

1. Make sure that NET Framework version 4.0 and higher is installed on your computer.
The problem is most likely with version 4.0

2. Make sure that the NET Framework SDK and NET Framework Runtime for versions 4.0 and
higher are installed on your computer. The problem is most likely with the SDK and Runtime
for version 4.0

3. Clean up the project (and best of all the solution), then try to build the project again:
[ProjectName -> Clean] or [Solution -> Clean Solution] then build again

If the above steps did not help, try removing one of the frameworks from the build
configuration of FontAwesome5.csproj and FontAwesome5.Net.csproj.

1. Open FontAwesome5.csproj file (double click on the FontAwesome5)
2. Remove problematic version from <TargetFrameworks>netstandard1.4;netstandard2.1;net40;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>
3. Open FontAwesome5.Net.csproj file (double click on the FontAwesome5.Net)
4. Remove problematic version from <TargetFrameworks>net40;net462;net472;netcoreapp3.1;net5.0-windows</TargetFrameworks>
5. Build solution
6. Revert the changes to files FontAwesome5.csproj and FontAwesome5.Net.csproj
7. Solution -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Configuration
8. Uncheck Build option for FontAwesome5 and FontAwesome5.Net
9. Rebuild solution

The problem is most likely with net40
